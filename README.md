This repository contains my Task 2 submission for the Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The project involves analyzing and visualizing the Titanic dataset using Power BI to uncover insights about passenger demographics, fare distribution, and survival rates.

🔍 Key Insights & Visualizations
Passenger Count by Gender – Bar chart showing the number of male and female passengers.

Fare Distribution by Gender – Comparison of total fare spent by males and females.

Survival Analysis by Gender & Class – Pie & donut charts showing survival percentages.

Interactive Filtering – Dynamic visual elements to explore the dataset effectively.

🛠️ Tools Used
Power BI – Data visualization & dashboard creation

Titanic Dataset – Public dataset for survival analysis

DAX & Data Cleaning – Pre-processing and enhancing insights
